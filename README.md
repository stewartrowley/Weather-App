# Overview

## Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.

I used Django for my web app. I made an app that makes a python request. Using an api. Using the open weather site. it will display what city you type in and the city of Rexburg. The way you start the server is through a command in the terminal to run the server. You have to create a project first and then a web app. Then you can run the server. The command is python manage.py runserver. 

## Describe your purpose for writing this software.

My purpose was to learn how to use the Django framework. To make a web app using django. I have made web apps a little before with html, css and Javascript. I did this to prepare for the project our team is doing this semester.

## Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.

# Web Pages

## Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.

The home page has you select what city of weather you want to view. It has a navigation bar to select between the two pages. The second page gives you more detail of the weather in Reburg. It is its own site of Rexburg weather. It also has a navigation bar in it. To navigate between the both of them.
